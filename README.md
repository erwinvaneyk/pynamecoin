PyNamecoin
===========
A Python wrapper for the Namecoin (NMC) API, using the standard Namecoin-client.

Installation
-----------
There are two ways to install this package, pip or manually. Preferably use the simple pip-installation, incredibly easy. 
* pip:
```
pip install pynamecoin
```
* custom:
1. Download one of the recent releases on the Releases-page.
2. Move this folder to your Python installation, under /plugins/
3. Done!

Usage
-----------
1. Run a server-instance of namecoind.exe. The first instance without any args will automatically be run as a server. 
An instance of the client is provided under <installation-folder>/pynamecoin/bin/namecoin/namecoind.exe
2. Wait a couple of minutes for the server to synchronize with the network. Note: No feedback is given in the commandline by the namecoind.exe.
3. Execute your script. For example: <installation-folder>/pynamecoin/bin/simple_example.py
